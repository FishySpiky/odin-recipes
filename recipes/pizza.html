    <h2>Description</h2>

      "A great recipe for homemade pizza dough and sauce. The sauce is
      especially good. Top with whatever you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pizza, an Italian dish with a round in shape made with a base of leavened
      wheat dough, topped with tomatoes, cheese, and an assortment of various
      other ingredients. The taste in your mouth is always great, the layers of
      bread, sauce, cheese, and toppings always impress me.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had a margarita cheese pizza with extra cheese on it for the first
      time, it became my favourite Italian food. It was a medium-sized pizza
      with six servings each person or three servings per person if they ate in
      pairs. To the touch, the pizza was hot and spongy.

      For all us pizza lovers out there, pizza from restaurants may be expensive
      but, we can make it ourselves at home. This recipe emulates the greatness
      of a pizza from a restaurant without breaking the bank. Enjoy!
